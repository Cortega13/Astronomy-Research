Validation Loss Definition

loss = abs(actual - predicted) / actual

This loss is calculated for each species and then the mean is calculated. This is calculated for the entire validation set.

Current mean loss for variational autoencoder: 5.2204e-01
Current STD of loss for variational autoencoder: 4.2515e-01

Current mean loss for 1 timestep with emulator: 2.4885e+03
Current std of loss for 1 timestep with emulator: 4.4960e+04
